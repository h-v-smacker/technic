# Ideas

## Replacer tool

Replaces the block the player points at with another one, in pre-configured orientation.

## Paint thinner - ok

Removes paint from spray can on a large surface (volume).

## Isolation transformer

Same tier, but breaks down circuits into parts

## Mixer

A machine to unite 2-4 ingredients without use of heat.

## Power autocrafter

Speeding stuff up

## Tiered hydro generators - ok

LV, MV, and HV; producing progressively more power.

## MV Sawmill

For industrial purposes

## HV alloying furnace

Same as above

## Nuclear batteries

Using regular fission of the isotopes to convert heat into electricity, such batteries reliably produce a lot of power, but degrade over time. Can be used as a "moderate" nuclear option.

## Redo machine upgrade system

Allow more options for upgrades, e.g. for speed at the expense of power, or to eject items only when a full stack has been accumulated.

## Planting boxes - ok

That don't need water and look green on top - to have farm plants grown for decoration.

## Fix the green saw air gap

The algorithm need to have some idea about moving away from a trunk

## Solar panel cost adjustment

Too expensive as they are now

## Radioactive signs -- ok

nuff said

## Herbicide and Herb growth stimulant

Herbicide - removes grass ( -> dirt)
HGS - spreads the grass type around

## Include mesecons, pipeworks, and digilines

For coherency's sake

## New constructors - ok

2+ = 3 blocks  
3+ = 5 blocks  
even better -> mk-N system 

## Proper concrete

A block that starts as liquid, spreads, and then solidifies.
